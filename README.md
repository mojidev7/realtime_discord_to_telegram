1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mojidev7/realtime_discord_to_telegram.git
   cd realtime_discord_to_telegram
   ```

   ```

3. Configure your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Discord and Telegram tokens
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the `config.json` file to map Discord channels to Telegram chats:

```json
{
  "channel_mapping": [
    {
      "discord_channel_id": "YOUR_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID",
      "telegram_chat_id": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"
    }
  ],
  "message_format": "{username}: {message}"
}
```

## üîß Usage

Run the bot with:

```bash
python main.py
```

For production deployment, consider using a process manager like PM2:

pm2 start main.py --name discord-telegram-relay --interpreter python3
```

## üìù Example

When a message is sent in a configured Discord channel:

```
User123: Hello world! Check out this image.
[Image attachment]
```

It appears in the linked Telegram chat as:

```
Discord | User123: Hello world! Check out this image.
[Forwarded image]
```

## üîí Security

- Bot tokens should be kept secure and never committed to version control
- Use Discord permission system to limit the bot's access
- Monitor the bot's activity regularly
